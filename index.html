    <p class="small-text">It literally makes no sense for you to come here, no need to scan that QR code. Why would you do that?
        There is a term for this kind of behaviour; it's called 'CHUL'. You have a lot of it. You graduated, you get a nice greeting
        card, you could be happy, you could celebrate, but NO, you have to scan and look further. CHULBAZ</p>
